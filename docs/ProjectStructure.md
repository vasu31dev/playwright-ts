## Project Structure

This project is meticulously organized into distinct packages and files, each tailored for a specific purpose:

- **.husky**: Husky streamlines the management of Git hooks, allowing for the execution of specific scripts during various Git stages. In this framework, Husky is configured to prevent commits with linting errors by running the `npm run lint` command (which maps to `eslint . --ext .ts` as defined in `package.json` under the `scripts` section) before every commit. If linting errors are detected, commits are halted until the issues are addressed.

  > **Tip**: Quickly rectify linting errors by running the `npm run lint:fix` command. Once resolved, you can proceed with commits if the Husky hook is successful.

- **docs**: This directory hosts the images and document files referenced in README.md.

- **src/vasu-playwright**: This directory houses the framework setup and associated utilities. The farmework structure is organized as:

  - **setup**: This directory is pivotal for initializing the testing framework and setting up the environment. It contains configurations, initializations, and any global setups required for the tests to run. The [Framework and Page setup](FrameworkSetup.md) section provides a deeper dive into how the framework is structured and how pages are initialized for testing.

  - **utils**: A crucial directory that encompasses all test-related [utility functions](Utilities.md). These are reusable functions or methods written to perform common tasks, be it related to data manipulation, element interaction, or any other recurrent actions or assertions in the test scripts.

- **tests**: This directory houses the framework setup, end-to-end test files, API tests, and associated utilities. The tests are organized as:

  - **pages**: This is where the [page objects](../README.md#page-objects) reside. Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern that allows for better test maintenance and reduces code duplication. Each file in this directory typically represents a page or a component of the application, encapsulating the elements and actions specific to that page or component.

  - **testdata**: This directory is dedicated to storing test data, which is often externalized from test scripts to allow for easier management and data-driven testing. The data is primarily formatted as JSON objects, making it easily readable and modifiable without delving into the test scripts themselves.

  - **specs**: Here, you'll find all the [spec files](../README.md#writing-tests-in-a-spec-file). These are the actual test scripts, written to test specific functionalities or features of the application. Each spec file usually corresponds to a feature or functionality, containing one or multiple test scenarios related to it.

- **.eslintrc**: This file is the heart of the ESLint configuration. ESLint is a static code analysis tool that identifies problematic patterns found in Typescript code. The configurations in `.eslintrc` dictate the rules and standards the code should adhere to, ensuring consistency and best practices across the codebase.

- **.prettierrc**: Prettier is an opinionated code formatter, ensuring that the code adheres to a consistent style. The `.prettierrc` file contains specific formatting rules, like line length, indentation, and more, ensuring that every developer working on the project produces code with a consistent style.

- **.gitignore**: This file ensures the repository's cleanliness by listing files and directories that Git should not track. It typically excludes node modules, build folders, and temporary files, ensuring only essential code and files are versioned.

- **README.md**: The initial file seen in a repository, the [README.md](../README.md) offers a snapshot of the project. It details the project's purpose, setup instructions, and usage. A well-structured README aids in onboarding new developers and offers clarity to stakeholders.

- **package.json**: Acts as the manifest for your project, detailing metadata like the project's name, version, and description. More importantly, it lists the project's dependencies and devDependencies, scripts that can be run, and other configurations.
- **package-lock.json**: This is an auto-generated file that provides detailed versioning of each package and its dependencies. It ensures that every install results in the exact same file structure in `node_modules` across all setups, leading to consistent behavior and builds.

- **playwright.config.ts**: This configuration file is pivotal for the Playwright testing framework. It centralizes settings specific to Playwright, detailing configurations for various browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices. Within this file, you can specify configurations such as viewport sizes, user agent strings, launch options, and more. These settings ensure that tests run consistently across different environments and scenarios, replicating real-world conditions.

- **tsconfig.json**: This configuration file is essential for TypeScript projects. It specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the TypeScript project. It can dictate various settings, from the target JavaScript version, module system, and source map options, to including or excluding specific files or directories.

- **playwright-report**: This directory is auto-generated during the initial test run, based on the [Playwright reporters](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters) configuration. The report file is updated after each test run. For more on viewing the reports, see [here](../README.md#report-generation-and-viewing).
