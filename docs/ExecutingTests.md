## Executing Tests

### Run tests using the Playwright plugin

To run the tests using the Playwright plugin in Visual Studio Code, please follow the instructions below:

#### Playwright Plugin Installation:

1. Click on the `Extensions` icon in Visual Studio Code and search for `Playwright`.

2. Select and install the `Playwright Test for VSCode` plugin.

#### Test Configuration

Playwright offers various configuration options for customizing test execution. Configuration settings can be specified in the `playwright.config.ts` file.

1. **`testDir: './tests'`**: Specifies the directory where tests are located. Tests within this directory will be executed.

2. **`retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0`**: Determines the number of times to retry failed tests. In this example, the retries value is set to 2 in a continuous integration (CI) environment and 0 during local test execution.

3. **`workers: process.env.CI ? 3 : 1`**: Sets the number of worker threads for running tests. In this example, the workers value is set to 3 in a CI environment and 1 during local test execution.

4. **`reporter: [['./tests/setup/custom-logger.ts'], ['html', { open: 'never' }], ['dot']]`**: Configures a custom HTML reporter with a logger. Multiple reporters can be defined.

5. **`headless`**: Determines whether tests should run in headless or headed browsers. The default value is headless.

6. **`testIdAttribute`**: Specifies the QAID attribute added to HTML elements for locating them during test execution.

7. **`baseURL`**: Defines a base URL used in actions like `await page.goto('/')` for navigation.

8. **`trace: 'retain-on-failure'`**: Provides a trace when a test fails.

9. **`screenshot: 'only-on-failure'`**: Captures a screenshot only when a test fails.

10. **`projects`**: Configures projects for different browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) and viewport settings for web and mobile.

For more in-depth configuration details, consult the official [Playwright Test Configuration Documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration).

#### Running Tests with the Plugin:

1. Once the plugin is installed, you will see a small green `Play` button next to each test in your spec files.

2. Clicking on the `Play` button will execute the test as per the configurations set in playwright.config file. You can either execute individual tests or all tests together within the spec file.
